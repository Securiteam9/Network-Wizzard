# Network Wizard

The Network Wizard is a Python script that utilizes Nmap commands to perform network scanning and analysis. It provides a user-friendly menu for performing various Nmap scans and gathering information about network hosts and services.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3: Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

- Nmap: The Network Wizard relies on Nmap for network scanning. Ensure that Nmap is installed and available in your system's PATH.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the Python script to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the `network_wizard.py` file.

3. Run the script using the following command:



## Usage

1. Upon running the script, you will see a menu with different options for network scanning.

2. Choose the desired option by entering the corresponding number and pressing Enter.

3. Follow the prompts to input the necessary information, such as the target IP address or hostname, port numbers, etc.

4. The script will execute the selected Nmap command and display the results in the terminal.

5. Review the scan results and utilize the obtained information for network exploration and security auditing purposes.

## Requirements

Before running the Network Wizard tool, ensure that you have the following requirements met:

1. Python 3: The tool is written in Python, so you need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Nmap: The Network Wizard relies on Nmap for network scanning and analysis. Make sure Nmap is installed on your machine and accessible from the command line. You can download Nmap from the official website: https://nmap.org/download.html

3. Operating System: The Network Wizard should work on most major operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. However, it's recommended to use a Unix-like environment (e.g., macOS or Linux) for the best experience.

4. Administrative Privileges: Some Nmap scans may require administrative privileges, especially if you're scanning privileged ports or performing aggressive scans. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to execute Nmap commands.

5. Internet Connectivity: To perform network scans, ensure that you have a working internet connection. The tool relies on network communication to interact with target hosts and retrieve scan results.

6. Dependencies: The Network Wizard has minimal dependencies beyond Python and Nmap. However, it's advisable to have a stable internet connection during the initial setup to install any required Python libraries, if prompted.

Please note that the above requirements are general guidelines, and your specific environment may have additional considerations or dependencies. It's always a good practice to review the official documentation of Python and Nmap for the most up-to-date information on installation and usage.
